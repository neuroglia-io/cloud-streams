# Cloud Streams Code of Conduct

Cloud Streams is dedicated to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all participants, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This Code of Conduct applies to all Cloud Streams spaces, including but not limited to GitHub repositories, issue trackers, Slack channels, email communications, social media, and events.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [info@neuroglia.io](mailto:info@neuroglia.io). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
